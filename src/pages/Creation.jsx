      <h1>3DS Max</h1>
      <p>
        Autodesk 3ds Max, formerly 3D Studio and 3D Studio Max, is a
        professional 3D computer graphics program for making 3D animations,
        models, games and images. It is developed and produced by Autodesk Media
        and Entertainment. It has modeling capabilities and a flexible plugin
        architecture and must be used on the Microsoft Windows platform. It is
        frequently used by video game developers, many TV commercial studios,
        and architectural visualization studios. It is also used for movie
        effects and movie pre-visualization. 3ds Max features shaders (such as
        ambient occlusion and subsurface scattering), dynamic simulation,
        particle systems, radiosity, normal map creation and rendering, global
        illumination, a customizable user interface, and its own scripting
        language.

      <h1>Maya</h1>
      <p>
        Maya is an application used to generate 3D assets for use in film,
        television, games, and commercials. The software was initially released
        for the IRIX operating system. However, this support was discontinued in
        August 2006 after the release of version 6.5. Maya was available in both
        "Complete" and "Unlimited" editions until August 2008, when it was
        turned into a single suite.[11] Users define a virtual workspace (scene)
        to implement and edit media of a particular project. Scenes can be saved
        in a variety of formats, the default being .mb (Maya D). Maya exposes a
        node graph architecture. Scene elements are node-based, each node having
        its own attributes and customization. As a result, the visual
        representation of a scene is based entirely on a network of
        interconnecting nodes, depending on each other's information. For the
        convenience of viewing these networks, there is a dependency and a
        directed acyclic graph. Nowadays, the 3D models can be imported to game
        engines such as Unreal Engine and Unity.

      <h1>Photoshop</h1>
      <p>
        Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by
        Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS. It was originally created in 1988 by
        Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, the software has become the industry
        standard not only in raster graphics editing, but in digital art as a
        whole. The software's name is often colloquially used as a verb (e.g.
        "to photoshop an image", "photoshopping", and "photoshop contest")[5]
        although Adobe discourages such use.[6] Photoshop can edit and compose
        raster images in multiple layers and supports masks, alpha compositing
        and several color models including RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot color, and
        duotone. Photoshop uses its own PSD and PSB file formats to support
        these features. In addition to raster graphics, Photoshop has limited
        abilities to edit or render text and vector graphics (especially through
        clipping path for the latter), as well as 3D graphics and video. Its
        feature set can be expanded by plug-ins; programs developed and
        distributed independently of Photoshop that run inside it and offer new
        or enhanced features.

      <h1>Wwise</h1>
      <p>
        The Wwise authoring application uses a graphical interface to centralize
        all aspects of audio creation. The functionality in this interface
        allows sound designers to: Import audio files for use in video games
        Apply audio plug-in effects Mix in real-time Define game states Simulate
        audio environments Manage sound integration Apply the Windows Spatial
        Audio API, or Dolby Atmos. Wwise allows for on-the-fly audio authoring
        directly in game. Over a local network, users can create, audition, and
        tweak sound effects and subtle sound behaviors while the game is being
        played on another host. Wwise also includes the following components:
        Cross-platform sound engine (Wwise Authoring) Multichannel Creator
        (allows creation of multichannel audio) Plug-in architecture for source,
        effect, and source control plug-ins, part of Wwise Launcher SoundFrame
        API Wave Viewer (allows for sampling of WAV audio files)
